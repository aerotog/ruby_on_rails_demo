# Ruby on Rails: Demo Application

This is an application to demonstrate my understanding and ability with Ruby on Rails. It should be hosted on Heroku at ADD_URL_LINK.

This app was developed to demonstrate my abilities with Ruby on Rails. The app was implemented using Rails 4.2.0 on Ubuntu and is currently hosted on Heroku. Checkout the source at <a href='https://github.com/aerotog/sample_app'>GitHub</a>! 

The app's design pattern is based on a Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl.
