  This app was developed to demonstrate my abilities with Ruby on Rails. The app was implemented using Rails 4.2.0 on Ubuntu and is currently hosted on Heroku. Checkout the source at <a href='https://github.com/aerotog/sample_app'>GitHub</a>! 

  The app's design pattern is based on a Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl.
